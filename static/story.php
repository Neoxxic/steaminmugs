	  				<p>Steamin'Mugs first started on the 27th of May, 2010. It was first established at 403 east virgo st. Dream village , caloocan city, metro manila , philippines. The name of the store "Steamin'Mugs" was inspired by the aroma of a new brew coffee and the sweetness of the pastries that lingers to the nose. The name of the products are derived from different Tagalog phrases. The first coffee product thatbwas released is the Mutya and for the pastry, Rajah.Steamin'Mugs is a friendly cafe owned by a group of friends who loves coffee and pastries. It is perfect place to spend some alone time, have a pleasant coffee date with your friends or loved ones, or to  read your favorite books in the midst of its cozy and breezy ambiance.Not just the atmosphere, but also the taste of the coffee, which has an unique taste and is produced from our local farmers in Batangas.</p>
